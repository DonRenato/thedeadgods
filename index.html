            <p><u><b>Introducing The Dead Goods</b></u></p>
            </br>
            <p>Yes, it is true. On the morning of 12th May 2006, six supposedly dead rock stars walked into the
                offices of Colly Logic Records and announced their intentions to bring their music to the world once
                more.
                The six - Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Kurt Cobain, Jeff Buckley, Janis Joplin and Keith Moon - have
                actually been on a small island called Flatey just off the coast of Iceland all along, piecing
                together the 12 songs
                for their comeback album <em>Six Feet Over</em>. Founder member Elvis Presley backed out at the
                eleventh hour, citing ongoing commitments with his cod farm as the reason for his withdrawal.</p>
